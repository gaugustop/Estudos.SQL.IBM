Patterns to search
    ex1
        select <column> from <table> where <column> like 'R%'
        select firstname from author where firstname like 'R%'
        % (wild card character) --missing letters
    ex2
        select title, pages from book where pages >= 290 AND pages <= 300
        select title, pages from book where pages between 290 and 300
    ex3
        select firstname, lastname, country from author where country='AU' OR country='BR'
        select firstname, lastname, country from author where country in ('AU','BR')

Results sets
    ORDER BY clause
        select title from book order by title --ordem crescente
        select title from book order by title desc --ordem descrescente
        select title, pages from book order by 2 --orderá por pages
        select title, pages from book order by 1 --orderá por title
        
    DISTINCT clause
        select country from author order by 1
        select distinct(country) from author

   GROUP BY clause
        select country from author order by 1
        select country, count(country) from author group by country
        select country, count(country) as count from author group by country

   HAVING clause -- works only with the groupby clause
        select country, count(country) as count from author group by country
        select country, count(country) as count from author
        group by country having count(country) > 4
        obs.: WHERE clause is used for filtering the entire result set
              whereas the HAVING clause is used for filtering the result
              of the grouping
